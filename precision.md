## About precision

**Note:** none of these issues should lead to a loss of funds, but they may result in a better or worse experience in
receiving the desired streamed amount over a specific time interval.

### Initial problem:

Initially, we have introduced the `rps` as an 18-decimal number to avoid precision issues, which is explained
[here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/?tab=readme-ov-file#precision-issues). The funds won't be stuck in the
contract, but delayed to be fully withdrawn.

We can deduct the delay formula:

$$ \text{delay} = \frac{ \left( rps*{18} - rps*{\text{deci}}) \cdot \right(T*{\text{range}}) }{rps*{\text{deci}}} $$

Using the `rps` with 6 decimals for 10 USDC per day ( $rps_{18} = 0.000115740740740740$ and
$rps_{\text{deci}} = 0.000115$), we would have the delays:

- 1 day: 10 - 9.936 = 0.064 ~9.3 minutes
- 7 days: ~1 hour, 5 minutes
- 30 days: ~4 hours, 38 minutes
- 1 year: ~2 days, 8 hours

Using the rps with 18 decimals:

- 1 day: ~0.0000000000005536 seconds
- 7 days: ~0.000000000003872 seconds
- 30 days: ~0.000000000012168 seconds
- 1 year: ~0.000000000414 seconds

Besides the delay problem, other issue for `rps` in token decimals would be, for tokens with a very high price to USD
(and ofc. if it has 6 decimals), the sender wouldn't be able to pay a resonable amount. Let's say WBTC with 6 decimals,
the minimum value that `rps` could hold is `0.000001e6` which leads to `0.0864WBTC = 5184$` per day (price taken at
60000$ for one BTC). Which is a lot of money.

For the reasons above, we can fairly say, that using 18-decimals format for `rps` is the correct choice.

However, this made us realize that the process of denormalization and normalization of `rps`, can also lead to precision
issues. A more nuanced one, as it requires an `rps` smaller than than `mvt = 0.000001e6` - miminimum value transferable
, which **wouldn't have been possible** if we were to keep the `rps` in token's decimals.

### About normalization

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Third condition is crucial in this problem.

We have the conditions under a problem appears (continuing with the USDC example):

1. `rps` is normalized to 18 decimals
2. token has less than 18 decimals
3. `rps` has non-zero digits to the right of `mvt` [^1]

### First example

Having a low `rps` results in a range of time $`[t_0,t_1] `$ where the ongoing debt would be constant.

Let's consider the `rps = 0.000000_011574e18`.

We need to find the number of seconds $`t_1 - t_0 `$ at which the ongoing debt remains constant:

```math
\left.
\begin{aligned}

\text{rps} &= 1.11574 \cdot 10^{-8} \cdot 10^{18} &= 1.11574 \cdot 10^{10} \\
\text{factor} &= 10^{18 - \text{decimals}} &= 10^{12} \\
\text{factor} > \text{rps} \\
\text{constant\_interval} &= \frac{\text{factor}}{\text{rps}} \\

\end{aligned}
\right\}
\Rightarrow
```

```math
\text{constant\_interval} = \frac{10^{12}}{1.11574 \cdot 10^{10}} \approx 86.4 \, \text{seconds}
```

As, the smallest unit of time in Solidity are seconds, we would have the
$`\left \lfloor{\text{constant\_interval}}\right \rfloor = 86 \, seconds`$ .

**Note:** In practice, this means that in order to stream one unit of the token, a constant interval or constant
interval + 1 seconds must passâ€”no more, no less. Below is a Python script that tests this.

<details><summary> Press to see the test script</summary>
<p>

```python
# 0.001e6 tokens per day
rps = 0.000000011574e18
sf = 1e12


# the ongoing debt will be unlocking 1 token per [constant_interval, constant_interval + 1] seconds
constant_interval = sf // rps


def ongoing_debt(elt):
    return elt * rps // sf


arr_curr_od = []
arr_prev_od = []


# track the seconds when ongoing debt increases and the intervals between those seconds
seconds_with_od_increase = []
interval_between_increases = []

for i in range(1, 86400 * 30):
    curr_od = ongoing_debt(i)
    prev_od = ongoing_debt(i - 1)

    arr_curr_od.append(curr_od)
    arr_prev_od.append(prev_od)
    diff = curr_od - prev_od
    assert diff in [0, 1]

    # if the diff is 1, it means the ongoing debt has increased with one token
    if diff > 0:
        seconds_with_od_increase.append(i)
        if len(seconds_with_od_increase) > 1:
            interval_between_increases.append(
                seconds_with_od_increase[-1] - seconds_with_od_increase[-2]
            )

            assert interval_between_increases[-1] in [
                constant_interval,
                constant_interval + 1,
            ]


print(
    "interval_between_increases 86 seconds",
    interval_between_increases.count(constant_interval),
)
print(
    "interval_between_increases 87 seconds",
    interval_between_increases.count(constant_interval + 1),
)

```

From this, we can conclude that the ongoing debt will no longer be _continuous relative_ to its `rps` but instead occur
in discrete intervals, with `mvt` unlocking every `[constant_interval, constant_interval + 1]`. As shown below, the red
line represents the ongoing debt amount for a token with 6 decimals, while the blue line shows the same for a token with
18 decimals:

#### The problem with discrete release

The issue arises because we store a snapshot time within the contract to calculate the ongoing debt between an action
performed on the stream and the next action, i.e. the elapsed time.

$od = rps \cdot elt$ where $elt = now - snapshotTime$

In the interval $`[t_0,t_1] `$ we have these possible scenarios:

1. $`t = t_0 `$
2. $`t_0 < t < t_1 `$
3. $`t = t_1 `$

For scenario 1, the snapshot time is updated to $`t_0`$, which is the best-case scenario because the previous unlock
interval has just ended, and the discrete release is in sync with the initially "scheduled" streaming period. We will
explain this further below.

For scenario 2, the snapshot time is updated to a value between $`t_0`$ and $`t_1`$, resulting in a delay of $`t - t_0`$
for the initially "scheduled" streaming period. Why? Suppose we are at second $`t = 100`$, and the recipient wants to
withdraw the maximum value possible, which in this case is 1, i.e. $`1 \cdot 10^{-6} \, \text{USDC}`$. The snapshot time
is updated to $` t `$, meaning there is a delay of $`100 - 87 = 13 \, \text{seconds}`$ . Please refer to the yellow line
in the graph below, which represents the new ongoing debt function. As we can see, the function shifts to the right.

We can deduct the formula (including a tolerance of 1):

```math
\text{delay} = t - \sum{\text{constant\_interval} - st - 1}
```

To determine the delay without calculating the constant interval, we can reverse engineer it from the rescaled ongoing
debt:

```math

\begin{aligned}
od_t &= \frac{rps \cdot (t - st)}{s_f} \\
Rod_t &= \frac{od \cdot s_f}{s_f}  \\
delay &= t - st - \frac{Rod_t}{rps} - 1 \\

\end{aligned}

For scenario 3, the situation is similar to scenario 2, but it represents the worst-case scenario, as the delay time is
maximized.
